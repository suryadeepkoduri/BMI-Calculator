# BMI Calculator

This is a Java program that I created to apply my basic Java programming skills. It calculates a user's Body Mass Index (BMI) and displays the result. The program also categorizes the user's BMI into one of four categories: underweight, normal, overweight, or obese.

## How to use

1. Download the source code from GitHub.
2. Open the source code in your favorite IDE.
3. Compile and run the program.
4. The program will prompt you to enter your height and weight.
5. Enter your height and weight in feet and kilograms.
6. The program will calculate your BMI and display the result.
7. The program will also categorize your BMI into one of four categories.

## Why I Created this ?

I usually check my BMI after checking my weight. I measure my weight in kg and height in feet but my in-built BMI calculator in my calculator and [BMI Calculator](https://www.calculator.net/bmi-calculator.html) doesn't support this. So I thought to create my own BMI calculator with the java programming skills i just learnt. This is just a basic program for calculating BMI so don't expect anything serious.

## What I learned

I learned a lot about Java programming by creating this program. I learned how to:

* Read input from the user.
* Calculate a BMI.
* Display output to the user.
* Categorize a BMI into one of four categories.

## Future improvements

I plan to improve this program in the future by:

* Adding more features, such as the ability to save and load BMI data.
* Making the program more user-friendly.
* Adding GUI
